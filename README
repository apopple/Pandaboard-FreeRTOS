DESCRIPTION
-----------

This demo builds an application and the FreeRTOS (http://www.freertos.org/) kernel for the Cortex-M3 processors
on the Pandaboard. The demo application will simply flash led D2.

------------
HOW IT WORKS
------------

The application and kernel are linked into a single file - Demo.bin. This file is loaded by U-Boot into
memory and a loader application is run on the MPU (Cortex-A9). The loader application sets up the L2 MMU
for the Cortex-M3 to map the load address of Demo.bin to the Cortex-M3 virtual address 0x0. The GPIO1 addresses
are also mapped into the Cortex-M3 virtual address space to allow the demo to flash the led. The loader then
releases the Cortex-M3 from reset at which point it should boot the application.

--------
BUILDING
--------

Simply run make - everything should build assuming mkimage and an appropriate cross-compiler are installed.

-------
RUNNING
-------

Copy boot.scr, loader.img and Demo.bin to an SD card with U-boot and X-loader already installed.  Insert the
SD card into the Pandaboard and reboot - U-boot should run the boot.scr automatically and boot the FreeRTOS
kernel on the first Cortex-M3 processor which will continuously flash led D2.
